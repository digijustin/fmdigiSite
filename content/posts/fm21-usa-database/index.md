I am proud to announce my FM21 <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/b9nyrunh37htdps/FMDigi-USA-ProRel-9TiersV1_0.fmf/file" target="_blank">United States Pro/Rel 9 Tier database</a> is ready. I'm very happy to share with everyone. I have updated to make the 2 Lower Leagues to be more regionalized so that California teams aren't in the same division as a team from New York. 

I have also included a <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/p2wnuu0wr6fzv8s/USFLLogos.zip/file" target="_blank">league logo pack</a> that can be dropped inside your Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2021\graphics\logos folder. If you have any other custom graphics, those may interfere with these logos.

Lastly, I have updated my <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/6cd9ff8ockjup30/FMDigi-ConcacafCL.fmf/file" target="_blank">Scotiabank CONCACAF Champions League file</a> to expand the current competition to more mimic the European version. It's not required to use my Pro/Rel database but I feel it makes for better gameplay. 

I hope you like them and if you run into any issues, please hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/fm_digi" target="_blank">Twitter</a> as it's the best way to get a hold of me.
