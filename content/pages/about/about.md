# About Me

What is up guys? It's Justin, AKA FM Digi. Welcome to my blog. I'm not sure what I am doing here but thanks for checking it out regardless. I live in Arizona in the United States and while I am a big fan of football (yes American football as well). 

I started playing Football Manager in 2014 with FM14 but didn't stick with it. I came back towards the end of the FM18 cycle and started watching YouTube videos then to learn how to play the game. 

Starting with FM19, I played a lot of Football Manager. I also found out about the Editor and started experimenting with different things. I made the crazy decision to create my own United States promotion/relegation database. I learned a ton doing that and spent about 4 months creating it. In the end, what I released has a lot of updates based on feedback. So I'm actively making those and hopefully will have them ready for the launch of FM21. I also created a database that expands the CONCACAF Champions League from 16 teams to a 96 team tournament that mimics its counterpart in Europe.

Shortly after that, I decided to begin streaming on Twitch and I really enjoyed it but realized that most of my viewers are in Europe when I was on. I found it easier to move to YouTube as that worked better with my schedule as well. The Football Manager community is a great one and one I'm so happy to be a small part of. I have met some awesome people here.

If you're still reading this, you are a legend. I'm looking forward to continuing on with my FM journey and making more content. I never thought I'd be doing something like this but now that I have, I can't imagine not doing it.
